## hey there

just your typical high schooler who happens to enjoy spending time with computers. started messing around with code because i thought it was cool, and somehow still here.

**currently:** student at [SMK Negeri 1 Muara Teweh](https://smkn1muarateweh.sch.id/)

## what i'm about

- problem solving through code (when it actually works)
- been into computers (and play station, of course) since i was a kid
- learning stuff on my own, one ~AI~ tutorial at a time
